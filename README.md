## 💻 Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. The dashboard will load sample data from `expense_data.json`

## 📊 Data Format

The dashboard expects data in the following JSON format:

```json
[
    {
        "date": "2024-01-01",
        "year": 2024,
        "month": "January",
        "merchant": "Merchant Name",
        "category": "Category Name",
        "card": "1234",
        "amount": 100.00
    }
]
```

> **Note**: Dates are now in ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Explicit `year` and `month` fields are required for filtering.

## � Migration Tool
If you have data in the old format (DD/MM/YY), use the included Python script to convert it:

```bash
python tools/convert_data.py input_data.json -o new_data.json
```

## 📄 PDF Converter Tool [NEW]
If you have a Bank Leumi credit card statement in PDF format, you can convert it directly to the dashboard's JSON format.

### Installation
```bash
pip install pdfplumber
```

### Usage

**Basic usage:**
```bash
python tools/pdf_to_json.py "path/to/your/statement.pdf" -o expenses.json
```

**Interactive mode** (categorize unknown merchants):
```bash
python tools/pdf_to_json.py "path/to/your/statement.pdf" -o expenses.json -i
```

The interactive mode (`-i` flag) will:
1. Identify all uncategorized merchants
2. Prompt you to select a category for each
3. Ask for a keyword to match (defaults to full merchant name)
4. Save the new rules to `category_rules.json` for future use

### Features
- **Automatic Categorization**: Matches merchants to categories using patterns in `tools/category_rules.json`.
- **Interactive Categorization**: Quickly categorize unknown merchants and save rules for future PDFs.
- **RTL Hebrew Support**: Correctly handles reversed Hebrew text from Bank Leumi statements.
- **Auto-Month/Year**: Calculates month names and years from transaction dates.
- **Installment Support**: Properly extracts installment transactions, recording the monthly payment amount.

## �🛡️ Security
- **XSS Protection**: Data rendering is sanitized to prevent Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
- **SRI Check**: External libraries (Chart.js) are loaded with Subresource Integrity hashes.
